# faceDecetorBackend


A simple website to take pictures and store them in a folder (imgs), and store names of people in pictures.
Also count how many users have taken their pics so we can later set limits to how many users can use it.
The final goal of this project is to register users through their pics in some sort of events, so we can provide this pictures to a machine learning algorithm that can recognize their faces when they show up for the event!
